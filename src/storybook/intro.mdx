## Using This Storybook

## Formatting Story Files
<Text>
  - export default
    - Describes the Component
    - title: the story “folder” title
    - component: from the imported component, what will be in the story
    - export variable NAME where NAME == story inside of folder
    - component proptypes = docs argos
    - agrTypes will allow SB to deal with custom event props (e.g. “handleClick” instead of “onClick”)
    - Use “ tags: ["autodocs"],” to generate documentation
  - Named Export
    - Describes the individual story/ies
    - Will show in sidebar as Function name, but could also use “name” arg to rename, useful for special chars or restricted JS words
    - Can build stories using other stories: https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories#how-to-write-stories
